# Projects


Three main projects written in C++, Python, and Golang.

The C++ project is an exploration of Artificial Intellegence 
agents to play a game of Dao using A* searching.

The Python project is an autonomous driving car that was
developed for a car-mounted Raspberry Pi.

The Go project is an exit project creating it's own 
encryption and then using this encryption to send
P2P messages within a blockchain.
